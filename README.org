* shoggy

=shoggy= is a 6x6 board, fairy chess variant with spell cards, written in Emacs Lisp.

[[file:screenshot1.png]]


=shoggy= was developed during the [[https://itch.io/jam/spring-lisp-game-jam-2024][Spring Lisp Game Jam 2024]].

- https://bcardoso.itch.io/shoggy


** Requirements

- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] 29.3 with SVG support (probably runs on older versions too)
- There are no third-party packages required.


** Installation

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Manual install
;; clone this repo:
;; git clone https://github.com/bcardoso/shoggy
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/shoggy")
(require 'shoggy)

;; With use-package + straight.el
(use-package shoggy
  :straight (shoggy :host github :repo "bcardoso/shoggy"
                    :files (:defaults "images" "sounds")
                    :build (:not compile))) ;; compiler won't be happy
#+end_src


** How to play

=M-x shoggy RET=

You can adjust and toggle some game options in the main screen.

** The rules

- No checks, no castling: when the =Sage= is captured, the game ends!
- No /en passant/: pawns can move one or two squares in their first move (you can toggle this behavior), and that's it.
- When a player is out of moves, it's game over.
- In each turn, you can either move a piece or cast a spell: you are given a spell card after every capture.
- You can't hold more than 3 cards at a time: cards are randomly discarded if your hand is full.
- All else is pretty much chess.


** The pieces

=shoggy= has standard and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_chess_piece][non-standard pieces]]:

| Name   | Atom | Range  | Value | Description                      |
|--------+------+--------+-------+----------------------------------|
| Pawn   | P    | 1 or 2 |     1 | A pawn                           |
| [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferz][Ferz]]   | F    | 1      |     2 | Advisor, like a 1 square bishop  |
| [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wazir_(chess)][Wazir]]  | W    | 1      |     2 | Like a Rook, also moves 1 square |
| Knight | N    | 2,1    |     3 | 2,1 Leaper                       |
| Rook   | R    | board  |     5 | Same as a Rook                   |
| Sage   | S    | 1      |    99 | Like a King, but wiser           |


** The spells

After each capture of an enemy's piece, you earn a spell card. In your turn, you can either move a piece or cast a spell.

There are three types of spells (for now):

| Spell   | Description                                                    |
|---------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
| BOOST   | Boost a piece's range (applies to Ferz or Wazir)               |
| PROMOTE | Promote a piece (Pawn -> Ferz/Wazir -> Knight -> Rook)         |
| DEMOTE  | Demote an /enemy/ piece (Rook -> Knight -> Ferz/Wazir -> Pawn) |


** The engines

=shoggy= has two engines to play against: =dumbfish= and =sanefish=.

- dumbfish :: tries to capture pieces or makes random moves
- sanefish :: tries to be a more reasonable fish (the default)


** The lore

=shoggy= was loosely inspired by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi][Shogi]], a Japanese chess variant (which you can play online at https://lishogi.org/).

At first I was planning to make a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minichess][Minichess]]/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Alamos_chess][Los Alamos chess]] variant, but I soon started to deviate into other directions.

I also had this idea a long time ago about adding playing cards into the game of chess. Perhaps in the future I'll add some more spell cards to =shoggy=. Also, check out [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knightmare_Chess][Knightmare Chess]], which I discovered during my research of the Game Jam.

So there are hundreds of chess variants and fairy chess pieces out there. This is my own :)
